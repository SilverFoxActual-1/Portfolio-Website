# Portfolio-Website
Sanitized html code for a simple and basic website to house a portfolio, or whatever you want.
It has multiple headers, image containers, button containers, hyperlink to a specified portion of one header.
I chose to host my simple site on AWS, but you could use/host this just about anywhere, I suppose.
